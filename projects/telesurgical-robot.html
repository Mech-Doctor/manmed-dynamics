    <p>
      The Telesurgical Robot is a ROS2-controlled robotic arm designed for remote surgery assistance and incision mapping.
      It integrates multiple sensor modalities including LiDAR, ToF, and ultrasonic sensors to measure wound depth and geometry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The robot captures high-resolution images mid-scan and feeds live data to an edge device. It is manually controlled via a joystick, with built-in automated linear scanning routines.
      Its applications range from wound assessment to precision surgical planning in underserved areas.
