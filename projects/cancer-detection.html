    <p>
      Our Cancer Residual Detection System uses real-time fluorescence-guided imaging to identify residual cancer tissue during surgery.
      The system is designed to enhance intraoperative visibility, reduce recurrence rates, and assist surgeons in achieving complete tumor removal.
      Unlike traditional pathology-dependent checks, our solution offers immediate feedback on margins while the patient is still in the OT.
    </p>
    <p>
      Key features include tumor-specific dye integration, camera calibration for low-light and near-infrared detection, and AI-powered image enhancement.
      It is optimized for deployment in both open and laparoscopic setups.
