    <p>
      This system continuously monitors patient vitals during surgeries and uses predictive models to flag potential risks in anaesthesia administration.
      It assists anaesthesiologists by suggesting dosage adjustments, alerting to anomalies, and tracking trends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Designed with safety-first logic and compliant alert thresholds, it also enables post-op data analysis for quality assurance and research.
