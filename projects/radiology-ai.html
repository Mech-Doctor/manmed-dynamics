    <p>
      The Radiology AI System is built to automate interpretation of radiology reports such as X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs.
      It extracts structured findings, identifies abnormalities, and translates free-text inputs into consistent, searchable diagnostics.
    </p>
    <p>
      This system is particularly valuable in high-volume hospitals where radiologists face bottlenecks in reporting.
      By using NLP and deep learning, it ensures improved triage, timely flagging of critical findings, and reduced reporting turnaround.
